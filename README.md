# VSCode Settings

This repository contains my personal settings for Visual Studio Code (VSCode). These configurations provide the most comfortable experience for me when using the editor, whether for work or side projects. You don't need to adopt all my settings; I've added comments to each section to make it easier to navigate. Additionally, you can hover over any setting within VSCode to view its brief documentation.

## Requirements

To fully utilize these settings, there are a few prerequisites:

### Font Family

You can choose from one of these three fonts:

- Geist Mono
- JetBrains Mono
- Fira Code

These are my preferred fonts, but you can easily change them to suit your preferences.

### Theme and Icons

Currently, I use the **Ros√© Pine** theme and the **Material Theme Icons** icon pack. Both extensions can be downloaded from within VSCode or from the VSCode Marketplace.

### Custom CSS and JS

To customize the UI, I use the **Apc Customize UI++** extension. This allows me to write custom CSS directly in the `settings.json` file without needing an additional file.

## How to Use

Follow these simple steps to apply my settings to your VSCode:

1. Copy the contents of `settings.json`.
2. Open VSCode and press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, then search for **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.
3. Paste the copied code into the opened file.

While it's possible to apply these settings via Git, I prefer this straightforward method.
